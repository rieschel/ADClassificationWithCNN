# ADClassificationWithCNN

Bachelor thesis. This project investigates whether Alzheimer’s MRI scans could be classified
more accurately using deep learning if the biological sex was considered. The
data used in the study were female and male Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and
Cognitive Normal (CN) MRI scans. The data was divided into a training and
test set. Three convolutional neural networks, based on the same architecture,
were trained on different data, one on the female training data (female model),
one on the male training data (male model), and one on both the female and
male training data (combined model). The female model was tested on the
female test data, the male model on the male test data and the combined model
on first the female and then the male test data.
The female model classified female AD and female CN pictures significantly more accurately than the combined model. The male model did not
classify male AD and male CN pictures significantly more accurately. Since
the female model achieved a significant difference, our study implies that there
could be a difference in the brains of males and females regarding Alzheimer’s.
